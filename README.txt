DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     http://www.pygame.org/
  PyOpenGL:   http://pyopengl.sf.net/
  Pyglet:     http://www.pyglet.org/



RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py

Because of some weird pyglet / pyopengl error some times the game crashes when
starting. Please be kind and try a few more times until it starts.


HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Move the blob using the arrows and jum using space.

Don't touch the spikes, don't get too close to the left edge.

Have fun.
