Blob Job

Once upon a time
in the kingdom of rhyme
everything seemed fine
for a good friend of mine

Wibbly Wobbly his name
fun and color his game
Squibly Skwobly his frame
smiles and laughter his aim

But on one sorry day
much to all our dismay
he was chasen away
by a blob all in gray

Every color it erased
All the laughter it negated
Every smile it deleted
all the fun it abolished

To recover his friends
and his land to defend
he must travel afar
and the rainbow befriend

Blob has stolen my rhymes
my good friend you must help
you must stop this slime
don`t let this be the end
